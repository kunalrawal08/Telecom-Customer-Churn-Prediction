## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to the **Customer Churn Prediction App**! This app is designed to help businesses analyze and predict customer churn using machine learning and interactive data visualization. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. Predicting churn is critical for retaining customers and improving business profitability.

This app provides a user-friendly interface to:
- Predict the likelihood of customer churn.
- Visualize key trends and patterns in customer behavior.
- Gain actionable insights to reduce churn rates.

## ✨ Features

- **📊 Churn Prediction**: Predict the likelihood of customer churn using a pre-trained machine learning model.
- **📈 Interactive Dashboard**: Explore churn trends, customer demographics, and usage patterns through interactive visualizations.
- **🔍 Data-Driven Insights**: Identify key factors contributing to churn and take proactive measures to retain customers.
- **🎯 Real-Time Predictions**: Get instant churn predictions by inputting customer details.
- **📂 Customizable Visualizations**: Create and export charts for reports and presentations.
- **📱 User-Friendly Interface**: Easily navigate between prediction and analysis tools with a clean and intuitive interface.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **📝 Prediction Page**: 
   - Enter customer details such as tenure, monthly charges, contract type, etc.
   - The app uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict the likelihood of churn.
   - Results are displayed in real-time, along with a confidence score.

2. **📊 Dashboard Page**:
   - Explore interactive visualizations of churn trends, customer demographics, and service usage patterns.
   - Filter data by specific criteria (e.g., contract type, payment method) to gain deeper insights.

3. **📌 Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Identify key factors contributing to churn (e.g., high monthly charges, lack of long-term contracts).
   - Use the insights to design targeted retention strategies.
